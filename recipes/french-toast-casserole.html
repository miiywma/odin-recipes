    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 (8-ounce) loaf crusty French bread, cut into bite-sized pieces, or more as needed</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Toppings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>To make the French toast: Stir brown sugar and butter together in a saucepan over medium-low heat until butter is melted and sugar has dissolved, 2 to 4 minutes. Pour butter-brown sugar mixture into the prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li>Scatter French bread pieces over top in a 1 ½- to 2-inch layer.</li>
            <li>Whisk milk, eggs, and vanilla together in a bowl until well combined. Pour over bread pieces, then press bread down with a spatula so the bread absorbs the liquid. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 8 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>When ready to bake, remove French toast from the refrigerator and discard plastic wrap. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To make the topping: Mix brown sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl; sprinkle evenly over the top of French toast.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is golden brown and set in the center, 50 to 60 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cut into squares; serve with some of the caramel from the bottom of the pan spooned on top.</li>
        </ol>
